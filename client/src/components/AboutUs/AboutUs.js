                </h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed text-md font-sans">
                  2 years ago, we started Only Fans because a few friends
                  approached us and said that they needed help to grow OnlyFans
                  because we knew a lot about marketing and branding. We then
                  did a test run with her and were able to achieve quite good
                  results, but it wasn’t enough for us. Then we got the best
                  mentors to help us, and through their strategies, we grew
                  enormously.
                  <br />
                  <br />A little bit more about The Bunny Agency: However, we
                  quickly realized that some of our mentors‘ methods were very
                  shortterm and not sustainable. So we took those strategies and
                  improved them over the course of a year so that we now have a
                  proof of concept that can help virtually all women on Only
                  Fans get into the top 0.1% and generate high 5 to low 6 figure
                  monthly sales.
